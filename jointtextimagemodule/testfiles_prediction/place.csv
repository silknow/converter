The frames are of carved and gilt-gessoed walnut. The seat rails of the set are arched at the centre and carved with over-scrolled inverted lambrequins framed by acanthus leaves. The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cambuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet. 
The set is covered in a material exactly copied from the original upholstery dating from between 1717 and 1723. It embodies two sorts of silver and two sorts of gold thread on a background of salmon pink silk which shows through the rich brocading to form a delicate linear pattern. 
The stools are numbered 'XI' and 'XII' on the secondary frame, which runs around the inside edges of the chairs and stools. This frame appears to be contemporary, though it has been strengthened by narrow beading all around, nailed to the frames themselves. Under the stools are labels marked 'North Heirlooms' followed by the number '28' or '29'. Under all the set the walnut frames have a yellow ochre colour where the gesso shows ungilded. The bolus, which shows through the gilding in places, is a brownish red.","http://data.silknow.org/image/4e7c0066-c347-3d13-b6f8-a46d80cb98d0"

<u>Design</u>
The cabriole legs have ball feet, each gripped by four bird’s claws, which, unusually, are pierced through at the lower end. The lower part of the leg is plain, rounded, with, above, a section carved with feathers (looking in places more like leaves), the top edges meeting the seat rail with additional, scrolled spandrel brackets. A lappet is apparently laid over the feathers, the edges moulded and scrolled into the ears of the cabriole leg with the outer edges carved as ‘reversed gadrooning’. The lower scroll of these meets an acanthus pendant, carved down the front of the leg. Below this, carved swags of fabric hang from a carved ring and appear to be looped back and knotted at the back of the leg, with carved tassels hanging down, all this forming the lower edge of the feathered section. On the knee, a scallop shell is carved over crossed palms. 
The back legs, which are continuous with the uprights and square sectioned with a curving rake, are cut on the front face cut with a decided kick. The inner edges are chamfered. 
The back is rectangular with a pierced central splat. The uprights taper upwards with an ‘S’ curve just below the junction with the cresting rail. The front faces have a moulding on the outer edge and are angled back towards the splat. This faces are carved with a foliated scroll at the base and a symmetrical device of scrolls flanking a shell.
The cresting rail is serpentine with outer corner extensions, heavily scrolled back in a tight paper-like scroll. The front faces of these are carved with acanthus and a small floral drop. The centre section of the rail is raised and is likewise heavily scrolled, the front carved with a scallop shell with crossed palms below. 
The outer side section curves of the centre of the crest rail continue down, scrolling into the pierced splat, which is composed of two opposed elongated scrolls, enclosing a circle. This which contains a carved crest showing an armoured leg with spur on a torque (the crest of Eyre). Below this is a further pair of scrolls with a leafy pendant, which touches the base rail of the splat, carved with two half rounds, one each side of the leaf. The shoe, into which the splat is fitted, is of standard pattern with a moulded top edge.

<u>Construction, seat and condition:</u>
Mortise and tenon construction, the uprights and back legs continuous. The seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and double pegged and tenoned into blocks above the front legs. The uprights are tenoned up into the top rail, the splat also tenoned up into this and down into the back seat rail. The shoe sits on top of the back rail and sits around the front three faces of the base of the splat, and the splat is pinned forwards into the shoe. The back seat rail is set with a single piece of mahogany veneer. This is broken away in places and may be a replacement.
The seat is upholstered in green silk velvet, now much faded and worn. Underneath a finejute base cloth is visible. The webbing is black and white chevron, 4.8 cm wide with 3 chevrons, with 3 widths back to front and 3 set laterally. All of these have broken through and loose horsehair is visible above. 
The seat  has rails of oak with softwood blocks attached with large handmade nails, these all late additions. The shaped spandrel block inside the proper right back leg is a replacement and the other back block is missing. There is evidence of old nails on the top inner surface of the seat rails. The spandrel blocks on the sides are lighter in colour and may be replacements.  The shaped corner block inside the back legs are late additions. 

<u>Damage</u>:
There is a fracture at the base of the splat. The front spandrel of the proper left front leg is missing.  The end of a claw on the front proper right foot and small section of claw on PL are missing.","http://data.silknow.org/image/415c704c-bae6-3ed1-92f8-57d9f66caf9e"

These usually hung from a lady archer's belt together with a quiver, a spare string, and sometimes a purse containing shillings.  Three golds (arrows in the centre) entitled a competitor to receive a shilling from each opponent. 

The kit has three parts: The acorn-shaped cup or pot contained grease (a mixture of mutton fat and tallow) which help the finger protectors or shooting glove slide more easily off the bowstring. The pricker is the tubular object with a sharp pointed stiletto used for marking scores onto the  card disc which holds a circular replaceable printed paper bulls-eye card with circles in gold, red, white, black and blue. Players scored nine for gold, seven for red, five for blue three for black and one for white. 

Archery was a popular pastime in the 19th century. Queen Victoria was an enthusiastic player.  It was one of the few sports open to middle-class ladies and provided opportunities for them to mix socially with the opposite sex without a chaperone.  This method of scoring archery goes back at least to the 1830s. Scoring in this way ceased at public archery meetings in 1872 and was succeeded by score books and pencils.","http://data.silknow.org/image/c37afa54-e4cf-392b-936a-bbe273322aa2"

Su armatura di fondo in raso da 8, prodotta da un ordito di fondo in  seta color amaranto, due capi, torsione S, e da una trama faccia pelo in lino ecrù, n.d. numero capi e torsione, il disegno è descritto in Gros de grain da una trama supplementare legata all'ordito di fondo raso. Trame supplementari in sete policrome legano all'ordito di accompagnamento descrivendo il motivo floreale in seta verde, rosa, avorio: minuti mazzolini  di ginestre, margherite, iris, lavanda, ginestre, si dispongono fittamente confondendosi col motivo floreale e a piccole pagode orientali del controfondo opaco del disegno in Gros. Il disegno si dispone ad andamento verticale e sinuoso; la sua ricchezza di motivi  confonde i piani, fondo sfondo, mono\ poli- cromia dello schema, richiamando sia motivi orientali che gusto quasi rococcò nei moduli floreali. È tipica rilettura di moduli antiche in chiave moderna. (Vedi tessuti Bevilacqua).","http://data.silknow.org/image/095047da-0e75-3490-9898-0d6062e3a9af"

Accessories made using the technique became fashionable during the late eighteenth century. Fine fabric, either linen or silk, was stiffened by starch so the threads would stick together. Then the fabric was punched using fine rounded metal teeth to push the threads aside rather than severing them, creating a lace-like pattern.

Examples of pierced work can be seen in waistcoats of the 1780s and 1790s, such as: 835-1907 and the present waistcoat panel T.110-1916, in the V&A collection.

Larger examples of pierced work such an apron: T.313-1920, and veil: T.314-1920 are included in the V&A Textile and Fashion collection.","http://data.silknow.org/image/88a8685c-7993-300b-874a-59acbabf7bf3"

The decoration of mirror frames with a wide inner border of embroidery seems to have been a popular accomplishment of amateur needlewomen particularly between about 1660 and 1680. This panel was being prepared for such a frame.<br><br><b>Design & Designing</b><br>The subjects and styles of embroidery chosen for mirror frames were close to those used for caskets, pictures, and other domestic items worked at home. Motifs were copied from pattern books and prints, or the satin panels could be bought already drawn out as 'kits', as this has been. The figures here are based on engravings  from Gerard de Jode's 'Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti', first published in Antwerp in 1585.<br><br><b>Subjects Depicted</b><br>This unfinished mirror frame shows scenes from the Old Testament story of Hagar and Ishmael. Hagar was the servant of Abraham's wife Sarah, who was unable to have children. When Hagar conceived a child by Abraham she showed contempt towards Sarah, who retaliated with such harsh treatment that Hagar fled into the wilderness.

The decoration of mirror frames with a wide inner border of embroidery seems to have been a popular accomplishment of amateur needlewomen particularly between about 1660 and 1680. This panel was being prepared for such a frame.<br><br><b>Design & Designing</b><br>The subjects and styles of embroidery chosen for mirror frames were close to those used for caskets, pictures, and other domestic items worked at home. Motifs were copied from pattern books and prints, or the satin panels could be bought already drawn out as 'kits', as this has been. The figures here are based on engravings  from Gerard de Jode's 'Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti', first published in Antwerp in 1585.<br><br><b>Subjects Depicted</b><br>This unfinished mirror frame shows scenes from the Old Testament story of Hagar and Ishmael. Hagar was the servant of Abraham's wife Sarah, who was unable to have children. When Hagar conceived a child by Abraham she showed contempt towards Sarah, who retaliated with such harsh treatment that Hagar fled into the wilderness. There she was comforted by an angel, and gave birth to her son Ishmael.","http://data.silknow.org/image/8cecbdd6-fff5-37b9-acab-7a689f19422f"

The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cabuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet.

This fabric was preserved with other cuttings of fabric to which Mrs Gammack attached notes which relate them to garments in the Princess's trousseau. 

It is not known how this fabric was used but it seems likely that is has an association with a royal commmission.","http://data.silknow.org/image/342b5ae3-a903-3ba3-9e82-dd3b699d9acc"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

Small parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular in the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. In this example the typically thin ivory stick with intricate carving appears too delicate to support the heavy double fringing of the cover. Fringing reached the height of its popularity in the mid 19th century. The Ladies Gazette of Fashion in July 1847 reported on parasols such as this with two rows of fringing, '[the] first row is that of the colour of the parasol, the second that of the lining, the effect is equally pretty and pleasing.' The peach fringing in this example reflects the peach silk lining which would have been displayed when the shade was held over the shoulder.","http://data.silknow.org/image/c88a8f86-783d-3b4c-a2e7-9e4d5cb855d5"

The recessed upper section comprises a central cupboard fitted with two glazed doors, lined with pink pleated silk; flanked by two pigeon-holes each over a small drawer. The right drawer is partitioned to form three small compartments at the left, the back one with a slope from front to back, and a single main compartment. No fittings (ink bottles etc.) survive.
Above the pigeon-holes are two blind lunette-shaped cavities, and behind these a serpentine-topped board which spans the full width of the superstructure, forming a top to the whole.
The whole is made largely of mahogany, including all three drawers and the backboard of the frieze-drawer cavity. [CHECK the backboard to the superstructure and the top board in better light.] The legs are fitted with square socket brass castors. 
All is veneered in satinwood, with pale stringing and rosewood(?) cross-banding, except for the legs which have dark (ebonized rather than ebony?) stringing. The front face of the top lunettes are inlaid with shells in pale wood against a green-stained ground. The six visible blockings at the top of the legs are also inlaid with shells in oval surrounds, in similar woods.","http://data.silknow.org/image/fd10a354-5f91-3ae8-b119-a30024de21a5"

Its design is typical of fashionable silks worn in the1720s.  The type of pattern repeat used was known as a point repeat, in which the pattern appeared in mirror image to either side of a central axis. This gave quite a formal effect to the pattern, but the overall effect could be lightened with delicate drawing of the individual motifs. In this case a trailling pattern resembling lace has been included. A lady at Court in the period, Mrs Delaney, described a dress she wore in 1729 as having ""a running pattern like lace in the ground"".","http://data.silknow.org/image/b0cd776b-a5be-31a3-9e32-d5d78a5d8938"

The loose front is open at the front and would have been worn over an underdress.  There is an inbuilt bustle at the back to help give shape to the dress.  The gown has two large lapels and a high collar fastened with hooks and eyes and trimmed with braid.  The collar and cuffs are decorated with pleated silk satin.  The two front ribbon ties are later additions and there is evidence of hooks and eyes at waist level which would have probably fastened some kind of belt to the front of the dress.  The dress is lined with cotton shirting ane the train is lined with stiffened muslin trimmed with lace.  The lining has been detached at some time for the purpose of cleaning.  The waist tie has a label sewn into it with the manufacturers name. It is fastened with a metal buckle stamped with 'Paris'.","http://data.silknow.org/image/46c9d495-8f27-3913-bfda-75c440488dc6"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.

The high quality ivory carving and fine silk on this folding carriage parasol suggests that the black lace adornment is genuine handmade Chantily lace as opposed to the extremely good imitations found on many parasols of this time. The small size of carriage parasols meant that manufacturers could use the very best in labour and materials, making them key in displays of wealth and taste. The Royal Victoria parasol displayed at the 1851 Great Exhibition had a lining of pink moiré silk starting a trend for shocking pink linings such as in this example. This bright flash of colour would have been revealed when the shade was held over the shoulder.","http://data.silknow.org/image/a6441586-605f-3615-87aa-51e2497b30bc"

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. If the top is a single piece of fabric in which the design is formed primarily through the stitching, such as this example, it is known as a 'wholecloth quilt'.

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design.

In early eighteenth century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Sumptuous silk quilts, such as this example, would have come to life under the gentle dance of candlelight. Inventories of the period reveal that they were a popular choice in the bedrooms of both middling and aristocratic households. The Drayton House inventory of 1710, for example, lists a 'white Sattain' quilt amongst its contents. This quilt's reverse of bold yellow satin would have made this quilt both highly fashionable and versatile, whereby either side could be displayed to enhance the decor of the room.","http://data.silknow.org/image/298c39bd-983e-3c76-a528-2fef132589bc"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

From the mid 1830s smaller parasols became popular for open carriage rides where they were best displayed. The sticks of these carriage parasols were thin and mostly made of wood or ivory as in this example. Here the ivory has been carved to resemble holly or blackthorn sticks with tiny pieces of red coral forming the knots in the wood. Red coral is also used at the end of the handle carved into the head of a classical looking woman, and at the rib tips where tiny dog's heads are barely visible under the tassels. A coral ring attached to the ferrule end is used to hold the cover closed when not in use.","http://data.silknow.org/image/531d5784-8a4b-3f84-a6a0-17bf52f90a7d"

The frames are of carved and gilt-gessoed walnut. The seat-rails of the set are arched at the centre and carved with over-scrolled inverted lambrequins framed by acanthus leaves. The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cabuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet. The chairs have tall raked upholstered backs.
The set is covered in a material exactly copied from the original upholstery dating from between 1717 and 1723. It embodies two sorts of silver and two sorts of gold thread on a background of salmon pink silk which shows through the rich brocading to form a delicate linear pattern.
The chairs are embroidered underneath: I, II, IIII, V, VII, VIII, VIIII or X on the secondary frame which runs around the inside edges of the chairs. This frame appears to be contemporary, though it has been strengthened by narrow beading all around, nailed to the frames themselves. Under all the chairs are labels marked 'North Heirlooms' followed by the number '20'. Under the chairs the walnut frames have a yellow ochre colour where the gesso shows ungilded. The bolus, which shows through the gilding in places, is a brownish red.","http://data.silknow.org/image/453f5640-ad0c-3fe7-a1fb-eb74d181d0d3"

Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was one of London's leading court dressmakers. 

In 1885 Queen Victoria commissioned her to make some of the garments for the trousseau of her youngest daughter Princess Beatrice who married Prince Henry of Battenberg on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne on the Isle of Wight. This fabric was preserved with other cuttings of fabric to which Mrs Gammack attached notes which relate them to garments in the Princess's trousseau.

According to the inscription, Taglioni performed two Spanish dances, a Herta and a Cachucha, dances more associated with her rival Fanny Elssler.  
The slipper was given to Lady Selina Bidwell, who may have been one of Taglioni's pupils when she was teaching dance in London in the 1870s.
The shoe formed part of the London Archives of the Dance.  The Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection was stored with the dance historian Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.

Historical significance: Ballet shoes from the mid 19th century are rare and this, associated as it is with Taglioni and the development of pointe work, is an important artefact in the history of ballet shoe construction.  The shoe is unblocked and the darning under the toe and up the sides would have been the only extra support for pointe work at this period.","http://data.silknow.org/image/0b3e6fce-6bb7-3257-a1bb-75fec85a730a"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

From the mid 1830s smaller parasols became popular for open carriage rides where they were best displayed. The sticks of these carriage parasols were thin and mostly made of wood or ivory as in this example. Here the ivory has been carved to resemble holly or blackthorn sticks with tiny pieces of red coral forming the knots in the wood. Red coral is also used at the end of the handle carved into the head of a classical looking woman, and at the rib tips where tiny dog's heads are barely visible under the tassels. A coral ring attached to the ferrule end is used to hold the cover closed when not in use.","http://data.silknow.org/image/d38e54f5-cdeb-32d1-b119-d902f5297dd9"

Glenham Hall was the seat of the North family. The set of furniture, which comprises ten chairs, two stools, and two settees, dates from the 1720s. It may have been made in 1722, when alterations were carried out Glenham Hall. The set is remarkable for its rich carving and original gilding.

The frames are of carved and gilt-gessoed walnut. The seat rails of the set are arched at the centre and carved with over-scrolled inverted lambrequins framed by acanthus leaves. The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cambuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet. 
The set is covered in a material exactly copied from the original upholstery dating from between 1717 and 1723. It embodies two sorts of silver and two sorts of gold thread on a background of salmon pink silk which shows through the rich brocading to form a delicate linear pattern. 
The stools are numbered 'XI' and 'XII' on the secondary frame, which runs around the inside edges of the chairs and stools. This frame appears to be contemporary, though it has been strengthened by narrow beading all around, nailed to the frames themselves. Under the stools are labels marked 'North Heirlooms' followed by the number '28' or '29'. Under all the set the walnut frames have a yellow ochre colour where the gesso shows ungilded. The bolus, which shows through the gilding in places, is a brownish red.","http://data.silknow.org/image/d8aab35c-4f6e-32c4-89c8-c1ac43b92d8a"

The back is unusual in that it includes a carved representation of a heraldic crest, thought to be that of the Eyre family of Eyrecourt Castle, Co. Galway.  Although crests were often carved or painted on hall chairs, they were not usually displayed on chairs intended for dining-room or drawing-room use. The early history of the chairs is not clear and needs further work.  The same crest was used by the Earl of Newburgh in the Scottish peerage.  The identification of the chairs as Irish is still tentative. It is based on their large scale and robust carving but more information on the history of the set is required.","http://data.silknow.org/image/415c704c-bae6-3ed1-92f8-57d9f66caf9e"

These usually hung from a lady archer's belt together with a quiver, a spare string, and sometimes a purse containing shillings.  Three golds (arrows in the centre) entitled a competitor to receive a shilling from each opponent. 

The kit has three parts: The acorn-shaped cup or pot contained grease (a mixture of mutton fat and tallow) which help the finger protectors or shooting glove slide more easily off the bowstring. The pricker is the tubular object with a sharp pointed stiletto used for marking scores onto the  card disc which holds a circular replaceable printed paper bulls-eye card with circles in gold, red, white, black and blue. Players scored nine for gold, seven for red, five for blue three for black and one for white. 

Archery was a popular pastime in the 19th century. Queen Victoria was an enthusiastic player.  It was one of the few sports open to middle-class ladies and provided opportunities for them to mix socially with the opposite sex without a chaperone.  This method of scoring archery goes back at least to the 1830s. Scoring in this way ceased at public archery meetings in 1872 and was succeeded by score books and pencils.","http://data.silknow.org/image/373d9461-56b2-3af1-b16b-28490a5bc550"

Accessories made using the technique became fashionable during the late eighteenth century. Fine fabric, either linen or silk, was stiffened by starch so the threads would stick together. Then the fabric was punched using fine rounded metal teeth to push the threads aside rather than severing them, creating a lace-like pattern.

Examples of pierced work can be seen in waistcoats of the 1780s and 1790s, such as: 835-1907 and the present waistcoat panel T.110-1916, in the V&A collection.

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

From the mid 1830s smaller parasols became popular for open carriage rides where they were best displayed. The sticks of these carriage parasols were thin and mostly made of wood or ivory as in this example. Here the ivory has been carved to resemble holly or blackthorn sticks with tiny pieces of red coral forming the knots in the wood. Red coral is also used at the end of the handle carved into the head of a classical looking woman, and at the rib tips where tiny dog's heads are barely visible under the tassels. A coral ring attached to the ferrule end is used to hold the cover closed when not in use.","http://data.silknow.org/image/a4ae215f-eff7-3e59-9d14-f66d23ccbf58"

The frames are of carved and gilt-gessoed walnut. The seat rails of the set are arched at the centre and carved with over-scrolled inverted lambrequins framed by acanthus leaves. The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cambuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet. 
The set is covered in a material exactly copied from the original upholstery dating from between 1717 and 1723. It embodies two sorts of silver and two sorts of gold thread on a background of salmon pink silk which shows through the rich brocading to form a delicate linear pattern. 
The stools are numbered 'XI' and 'XII' on the secondary frame, which runs around the inside edges of the chairs and stools. This frame appears to be contemporary, though it has been strengthened by narrow beading all around, nailed to the frames themselves. Under the stools are labels marked 'North Heirlooms' followed by the number '28' or '29'. Under all the set the walnut frames have a yellow ochre colour where the gesso shows ungilded. The bolus, which shows through the gilding in places, is a brownish red.","http://data.silknow.org/image/32480342-4f41-3a04-90d9-1009b7457283"

This and other Indian textiles exhibited there greatly impressed contemporary arbiters of taste not only by their craftsmanship but also by their designs. The flat, stylised floral patterns were seen as examples of 'perfect taste' and were contrasted with the over-elaborate, quasi-naturalistic designs that were currently in favour in Victorian Britain.<br><br><b>Materials & Making</b><br>This type of luxury fabric was usually used for canopies, furnishings and horse or elephant trappings as it was too stiff and heavy for garments. Gujarat in western India, especially the weaving centres of Ahmedabad and Surat, was well known for cloth of this type.

These usually hung from a lady archer's belt together with a quiver, a spare string, and sometimes a purse containing shillings.  Three golds (arrows in the centre) entitled a competitor to receive a shilling from each opponent. 

The kit has three parts: The acorn-shaped cup or pot contained grease (a mixture of mutton fat and tallow) which help the finger protectors or shooting glove slide more easily off the bowstring. The pricker is the tubular object with a sharp pointed stiletto used for marking scores onto the  card disc which holds a circular replaceable printed paper bulls-eye card with circles in gold, red, white, black and blue. Players scored nine for gold, seven for red, five for blue three for black and one for white. 

Archery was a popular pastime in the 19th century. Queen Victoria was an enthusiastic player.  It was one of the few sports open to middle-class ladies and provided opportunities for them to mix socially with the opposite sex without a chaperone.  This method of scoring archery goes back at least to the 1830s. Scoring in this way ceased at public archery meetings in 1872 and was succeeded by score books and pencils.","http://data.silknow.org/image/8c82ef1f-0eef-3751-a233-5b8d6f88d27a"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

Small parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular in the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. This is a typical example of the 1850s, with a thin carved ivory stick and embroidered cover which had become common place, The Ladies Cabinet reporting in 1850 'There is a profusion of embroideries on all materials this year.'","http://data.silknow.org/image/3206f563-1f5d-3c38-83f0-23febd5ef987"

Accessories made using the technique became fashionable during the late eighteenth century. Fine fabric, either linen or silk, was stiffened by starch so the threads would stick together. Then the fabric was punched using fine rounded metal teeth to push the threads aside rather than severing them, creating a lace-like pattern.

Examples of pierced work can be seen in waistcoats of the 1780s and 1790s, such as: 835-1907 and the present waistcoat panel T.110-1916, in the V&A collection.

Larger examples of pierced work such an apron: T.313-1920, and veil: T.314-1920 are included in the V&A Textile and Fashion collection.","http://data.silknow.org/image/ec9694d4-dda1-3668-bd2f-423f37c456d7"

It is also interesting as it has a small built -in bustle in the back, probably filled with straw.

The decoration of mirror frames with a wide inner border of embroidery seems to have been a popular accomplishment of amateur needlewomen particularly between about 1660 and 1680. This panel was being prepared for such a frame.<br><br><b>Design & Designing</b><br>The subjects and styles of embroidery chosen for mirror frames were close to those used for caskets, pictures, and other domestic items worked at home. Motifs were copied from pattern books and prints, or the satin panels could be bought already drawn out as 'kits', as this has been. The figures here are based on engravings  from Gerard de Jode's 'Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti', first published in Antwerp in 1585.<br><br><b>Subjects Depicted</b><br>This unfinished mirror frame shows scenes from the Old Testament story of Hagar and Ishmael. Hagar was the servant of Abraham's wife Sarah, who was unable to have children. When Hagar conceived a child by Abraham she showed contempt towards Sarah, who retaliated with such harsh treatment that Hagar fled into the wilderness. There she was comforted by an angel, and gave birth to her son Ishmael.","http://data.silknow.org/image/2fb9d1ae-39b8-3802-9012-24f0fa7cddab"

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. If the top is a single piece of fabric in which the design is formed primarily through the stitching, such as this example, it is known as a 'wholecloth quilt'.

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design.

In early eighteenth century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Sumptuous silk quilts, such as this example, would have come to life under the gentle dance of candlelight. Inventories of the period reveal that they were a popular choice in the bedrooms of both middling and aristocratic households. The Drayton House inventory of 1710, for example, lists a 'white Sattain' quilt amongst its contents. This quilt's reverse of bold yellow satin would have made this quilt both highly fashionable and versatile, whereby either side could be displayed to enhance the decor of the room.","http://data.silknow.org/image/f9e29697-63a2-3c2d-b704-9251106313b3"

Accessories made using the technique became fashionable during the late eighteenth century. Fine fabric, either linen or silk, was stiffened by starch so the threads would stick together. Then the fabric was punched using fine rounded metal teeth to push the threads aside rather than severing them, creating a lace-like pattern.

Examples of pierced work can be seen in waistcoats of the 1780s and 1790s, such as: 835-1907 and the present waistcoat panel T.110-1916, in the V&A collection.

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

From the mid 1830s smaller parasols became popular for open carriage rides where they were best displayed. The sticks of these carriage parasols were thin and mostly made of wood or ivory as in this example. Here the ivory has been carved to resemble holly or blackthorn sticks with tiny pieces of red coral forming the knots in the wood. Red coral is also used at the end of the handle carved into the head of a classical looking woman, and at the rib tips where tiny dog's heads are barely visible under the tassels. A coral ring attached to the ferrule end is used to hold the cover closed when not in use.","http://data.silknow.org/image/2c478117-cecd-309b-b455-d5879c7f6f45"
