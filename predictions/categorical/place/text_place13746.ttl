    prov:used "This drawing is a preparatory composition for a ceiling painting in the Hôtel de la Rivière on the Place Royale, which is today 14 place des Vosges. Built for Antoine Ribaud, controller of finances from 1606-1607, the hôtel was acquired in 1652 by Louis Barbier de la Rivière, bishop of Langres.  The contract for the commission dates December 31, 1652, and it details the decoration of two adjacent rooms on the first floor: \"la Grand Chambre\" and \"le Grand Cabinet.\" Le Brun painted a Triumph of Psyche on the ceiling of the Grande Chambre, which depicted four scenes depicting episodes from the life of Psyche.  In addition, each corner of the coving contained eight muses called upon by Apuleius to entertain guests at the wedding of Cupid and Psyche. The MMA sheet depicts the muse of music, Euterpe, who plays a flute; the second muse is Urania, the muse of astronomy, whose hand rests on her attribute-- the celestial globe."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
