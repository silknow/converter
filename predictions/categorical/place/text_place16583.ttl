    prov:used """Bridegroom's waistcoat of silk brocade, woven in colours on a cream coloured ground. Part of a Norwegian bridegroom's costume purchased by the donor in 1865 from the original owner. Cut in narrow v-shape at the neck, and straight down the front. The waistcoat has two false pockets with two filigree and tinsel metal buttons sewn to one side of the left poket. There are seven button-holes down the opening in front, edged with black silk braid.  

Linen and dark green cloth lining. There is a printed cotton back with a pattern consisting of small detached leaves, in brown and yellow on a buff ground. Historic records note the brocade is possibly of Russian weaving."""@en,

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
