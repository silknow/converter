        "This canopy was one of the many richly decorated textile furnishings used at the Indian court.  It would have been suspended over the <i>gaddi,</i> the textile used as the rulers seat.  The canopy represented divine sanction and protection, and also helped to mark out the royal space within the court.  The use of a canopy to denote kingship has a very long history in India, originating in the basic need to shield the ruler from the heat of the sun but evolving into a symbolic decorative structure that was often use in interior courtly settings."@en ;

The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
