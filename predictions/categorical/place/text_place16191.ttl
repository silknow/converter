    prov:used """The lower section comprises a table on square tapering legs, with a frieze drawer with baize-lined brushing slide (the green baize not original). The recessed upper section comprises a central cupboard fitted with two glazed doors, lined with pink pleated silk; flanked by two pigeon-holes each over a small drawer. The right drawer is partitioned to form three small compartments at the left, the back one with a slope from front to back, and a single main compartment. No fittings (ink bottles etc.) survive.
Above the pigeon-holes are two blind lunette-shaped cavities, and behind these a serpentine-topped board which spans the full width of the superstructure, forming a top to the whole.
The whole is made largely of mahogany, including all three drawers and the backboard of the frieze-drawer cavity. [CHECK the backboard to the superstructure and the top board in better light.] The legs are fitted with square socket brass castors. 
All is veneered in satinwood, with pale stringing and rosewood(?) cross-banding, except for the legs which have dark (ebonized rather than ebony?) stringing. The front face of the top lunettes are inlaid with shells in pale wood against a green-stained ground. The six visible blockings at the top of the legs are also inlaid with shells in oval surrounds, in similar woods."""@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
