    prov:used "Renowned for their knotted-pile carpets and storage bags, Turkmen weavers also produced magnificent examples of wearable art such as this remarkable coat. The decoration of the exterior consists of geometric and abstract floral motifs and is among the best examples of Turkmen embroidery. The abstract exterior decoration contrasts with the interior of the coat, which is lined with a bright floral-printed cotton made in Russia. The coat, a rare example of its type, is likely the work of either the Chodor or Yomut Turkmen."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
