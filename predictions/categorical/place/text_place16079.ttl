        """Mrs Caroline Gammack who preserved this fabric cutting worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Elizabeth Stratton. Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was one of London's leading court dressmakers. 

In 1885 Queen Victoria commissioned her to make some of the garments for the trousseau of her youngest daughter Princess Beatrice who married Prince Henry of Battenberg on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne on the Isle of Wight. This fabric was preserved with other cuttings of fabric to which Mrs Gammack attached notes which relate them to garments in the Princess's trousseau. 

It is not known how this fabric was used but it seems likely that is has an association with a royal commmission."""@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
