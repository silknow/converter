    prov:used "When he applied Arts and Crafts principles to wallpaper production, William Morris initiated a revival of the material in England. \"Compton\" was produced in 1896 for the house of Laurence Hodson, near Wolverhampton. Once believed to be Morris's last design, it is now recognized as the work of John Dearle, who managed Morris & Company's block-printing operations at Merton Abbey and succeeded Morris as director. The pattern is, nevertheless, a definitive example of the company style. Tulips and poppies are woven into a rich, flowing pattern inspired by, but not slavishly adherent to, natural models. The scale of the flowers indicates that the paper was intended for a large, ceremonial room, and the coloring is delicate despite the use of chemical dyes."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
