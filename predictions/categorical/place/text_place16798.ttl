        """The silk has a green ground with main pattern created by supplementary weft of white silk, bound in twill, and 7 further colours brocaded. 
Pattern is dominated by stylised urn with flowers, in point repeat, enclosed with lace-like trails. 
The silk is a loom width, and slightly more than two repeats in length. It appears to have been part of a petticoat, with the lower edge damaged as if trodden down at hem level, and the sides turned under at the selvedges, with remaining traces of stitching threads."""@en,
        "This fabric, a brocaded silk, was part of the petticoat from a lady's gown. Its design is typical of fashionable silks worn in the1720s.  The type of pattern repeat used was known as a point repeat, in which the pattern appeared in mirror image to either side of a central axis. This gave quite a formal effect to the pattern, but the overall effect could be lightened with delicate drawing of the individual motifs. In this case a trailling pattern resembling lace has been included. A lady at Court in the period, Mrs Delaney, described a dress she wore in 1729 as having \"a running pattern like lace in the ground\"."@en ;

The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
