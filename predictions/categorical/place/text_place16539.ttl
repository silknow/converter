        """The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

From the mid 1830s smaller parasols became popular for open carriage rides where they were best displayed. The sticks of these carriage parasols were thin and mostly made of wood or ivory as in this example. Here the ivory has been carved to resemble holly or blackthorn sticks with tiny pieces of red coral forming the knots in the wood. Red coral is also used at the end of the handle carved into the head of a classical looking woman, and at the rib tips where tiny dog's heads are barely visible under the tassels. A coral ring attached to the ferrule end is used to hold the cover closed when not in use."""@en ;

This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
