    prov:used "A woman's bodice of white silk over linen, reinforced with whalebone, lined with white silk taffeta, the inside faced with a figured white silk ribbon.  The bodice has a high wide neckline, long waist, pointed at front and back.  There were probably sleeves, but these have been removed.  There are 22 narrow laps (tabs) at the waist, each bound with white silk grosgrain ribbon.  The bodice laces at the back with 18 lacing holes on either side.  The white silk is embroidered with flowers in coloured silks and scrolls in couched silver strip."@en,

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
