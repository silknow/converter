ENGLISH; 1886
Probably designed by A.H. Mackmurdo (1851-1942)
Made by E. Goodall & Co., Manchester
Mahogany

A chair of this pattern was shown by the Century Guild at the International Exhibition of Navigation, Travelling, Commerce and Manufactures at Liverpool in 1886. Like much of the Century Guild furniture, it was made by Goodall and bears their stamp. [pre October 2000]"""@en,
        "Chair with mahogany frame, the high back and square seat both covered in silk and wool textile attributed to A.H. Lee of Birkenhead; the back terminates in an entablature with an central oval motif of contrasting veneer and the square section uprights of the back are finished with carved berry and leaf motifs at the top. The square section back legs are slightly curved outwards and the front legs curve out to the sides before terminating in square feet."@en,
        "The Century Guild showed the first example of this chair at their stand at the International Exhibition of Navigation, Travelling, Commerce and Manufacture in Liverpool in 1886. The entire contents of the stand were bought by Henry Boddington who employed the Guild to decorate and furnish his home, Pownall Hall, Cheshire, including a set of these chairs for the dining room."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
