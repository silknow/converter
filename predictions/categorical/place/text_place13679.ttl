    prov:used "A noble Roman, perhaps the emperor Claudius, stands lost in thought as he fingers a rich curtain. Elements in the study--the archeologically accurate tripod table, the textile decorated with an image of \"Amphitrite in Triumph\"--can be found in paintings that Alma-Tadema made beween 1865 and 1871. Born in Friesland, the artist studied in Antwerp, worked in Brussels then moved to London in 1870 where he pioneered a distinctive mode of historical painting that mixed history and genre with evocative, detailed settings. The present drawing likely was made by a student or admirer, and prods the viewer to recall Claudius's sudden rise to power when the Praetorian Guard murdered his corrupt nephew Caligula (Alma-Tadema painted versions of that subject in 1867 and 1871)."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
