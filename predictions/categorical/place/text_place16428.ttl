    prov:used """Red silk velvet, with embroidered pillar orphreys and ornaments.  On the orphreys are figures under architectural canopies surmounted by a white rose with a yellow fleur-de-lys. On the front orphrey from top down are St. Andrew, an Old Testament prophet, St Paul.  On the back orphrey are St Paul and two prophets. The ornaments on the body of the vestment consist of floral devices with the addition on the back of seraphim standing on wheels and carrying scrolls with the inscription "Da Gloriam Deo" (almost worn away), and two bells (probably a rebus).
The dalmatic in its current form has been altered, either from a straight-sided dalmatic, or a chasuble. the fringe and green braid are later in date than the embroidery."""@en,

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
