    prov:used "F. Dark green velvet redingote over green silk satin open front.  Lined with cotton shirting with a muslin under train trimmed with lace.  Made by Howell and James Ltd, 89 Regent Street, London.  British, about 1889"@en,
        """The gown is cut in the style of a moss green velvet redingote over a loose flowing front of green silk satin which is open down the centre.  It is very similar to an illustration of  a teagown on page 345 of 'Englishwomen's Clothing in the Nineteenth Century' by C.Willet Cunnington, Dover Publications, New York. It is also interesting as it has a small built -in bustle in the back, probably filled with straw.
This teagown resembles one worn by Ellen Terry in the collections of the Theatre Museum.  Ellen Terry, thought fashion conscious, was unconventional and preferred the looser lines of clothes advocated by the Dress Reform Movement"""@en,
        "The teagown is cut in the style of a redingote.  In the 1890s this name was applied to an outdoor coat with a fitted back and semi-fitted front. The fitted part of the gown is made of dark green plush velvet and is slightly trained. The loose front is open at the front and would have been worn over an underdress.  There is an inbuilt bustle at the back to help give shape to the dress.  The gown has two large lapels and a high collar fastened with hooks and eyes and trimmed with braid.  The collar and cuffs are decorated with pleated silk satin.  The two front ribbon ties are later additions and there is evidence of hooks and eyes at waist level which would have probably fastened some kind of belt to the front of the dress.  The dress is lined with cotton shirting ane the train is lined with stiffened muslin trimmed with lace.  The lining has been detached at some time for the purpose of cleaning.  The waist tie has a label sewn into it with the manufacturers name. It is fastened with a metal buckle stamped with 'Paris'."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
