        """The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.

The high quality ivory carving and fine silk on this folding carriage parasol suggests that the black lace adornment is genuine handmade Chantily lace as opposed to the extremely good imitations found on many parasols of this time. The small size of carriage parasols meant that manufacturers could use the very best in labour and materials, making them key in displays of wealth and taste. The Royal Victoria parasol displayed at the 1851 Great Exhibition had a lining of pink moir√© silk starting a trend for shocking pink linings such as in this example. This bright flash of colour would have been revealed when the shade was held over the shoulder."""@en,

The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
