    prov:used "This design for a torchère was made by the artist Le Barbier. He is best known for his paintings and illustrations which reflect the political unrest and revolutions in North America and Europe during the final decades of the 18th century. One of his most famous works is without doubt the panel with the Declaration of the rights of men and citizens as it had been decreed by the Assemblée Nationale in 1789 and agreed to by King Louis XVI (Musée Carnavalet, Paris). Like many of his French colleagues Le Barbier was active in various art disciplines however, and he produced multiple designs for the interior, including this elegant design for a torchère. The idea of having human figures - women, cherubs or exotic figures such as Indians or Africans - as a support, holding up a candle or base on top of which a candelabrum could stand, had become particularly popular in the 18th century. Smaller examples were often executed in (partially) gilt bronze while larger pieces could be made in polychrome wood, marble or gesso."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
