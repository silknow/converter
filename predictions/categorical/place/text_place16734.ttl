	Morris believed tapestry to be one of the highest  forms of decorative art. He did not begin production  until years after other forms of textiles had become  staple products of the firm. Despite this, he achieved  considerable success owing to the quality of the  weaving and the way in which his weavers  translated Burne-Jones' figure drawings into finished  tapestries. [2013]"""@en,

The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
