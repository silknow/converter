    prov:used "<b>Object Type</b><br>Work boxes, containers for sewing and embroidery tools and materials, often had many small compartments, which helped to keep the contents tidy. This box also has a drawer at the front, which opens by pulling a hidden catch.  This is an expensive example, with its leather cover and silk lining.  Many work boxes were simpler, comprising plain veneered wood.<br><br><b>Ownership & Use</b><br>This work box  has many of its original fittings such as two fixed pin cushions covered with printed silk, and several lidded compartments.  It also has a collection of small tools and souvenirs, such as a pin cushion in inlaid wood with cushions at each end, which bears a paper label that reads 'A trifle from BRIGHTON'. There is also an ivory tape measure with its original silk tape, and a tiny circular needle case covered in green silk.<br><br><b>People</b><br>We do not know who originally owned this work box.  There is a brass plaque on the outside of the lid, but it has not been engraved with initials.  The box was given to the V&A by Queen Mary, consort of George V (ruled 1910-1936).  She collected antiques, and often bought items specifically to give to the V&A."@en,

Fitted work boxes were made from about 1800, replacing the chatelaines and embroidered bags or pockets in which women had previously kept their sewing and embroidery tools. Small items for needlework, such as the pin cushion in this box, made popular gifts and souvenirs. [27/03/2003]"""@en ;

The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
