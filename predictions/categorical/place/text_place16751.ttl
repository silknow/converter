    prov:used "<b>Object Type</b><br>Mirror glass had a considerable intrinsic value in the 17th century, and the presence of a relatively small piece could be increased with a broad decorated frame. The decoration of mirror frames with a wide inner border of embroidery seems to have been a popular accomplishment of amateur needlewomen particularly between about 1660 and 1680. This panel was being prepared for such a frame.<br><br><b>Design & Designing</b><br>The subjects and styles of embroidery chosen for mirror frames were close to those used for caskets, pictures, and other domestic items worked at home. Motifs were copied from pattern books and prints, or the satin panels could be bought already drawn out as 'kits', as this has been. The figures here are based on engravings  from Gerard de Jode's 'Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti', first published in Antwerp in 1585.<br><br><b>Subjects Depicted</b><br>This unfinished mirror frame shows scenes from the Old Testament story of Hagar and Ishmael. Hagar was the servant of Abraham's wife Sarah, who was unable to have children. When Hagar conceived a child by Abraham she showed contempt towards Sarah, who retaliated with such harsh treatment that Hagar fled into the wilderness. There she was comforted by an angel, and gave birth to her son Ishmael."@en,

EMBROIDERED MIRROR FRAME AND UNFINISHED FRAME<br>
From about 1660 to 1680 a popular activity for amateur needlewomen was the embroidery of frames for mirrors. The maker may have drawn out the motifs herself, or bought a ready-drawn panel. The unfinished panel shows that the maker had worked some areas in great detail before starting on new motifs. Both panels use common imagery such as the King and Queen and characters from the Bible.

The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
