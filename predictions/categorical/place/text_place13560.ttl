    prov:used "As court artist, Cranach often accompanied his patron, Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, on hunting excursions to his numerous hunting lodges, drawing book in hand. Cranach produced a number of paintings and murals of hunts and animals, for which he received great renown in his time. This woodcut, dating from 1506, is his earliest and largest hunting print. Composed of two separate blocks, it vividly depicts the outing in narrative form. Moving clockwise from the upper left, one can follow the elector’s dogs as they give chase, culminating in a stag’s demise at the lower left, possibly by the hand of the elector himself. The lodge, probably the castle at Lochau, is seen in the distance."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
