    prov:used "This large gold ring is one of 43 objects in the museum's collection from a single tomb discovered near Bolsena, north of Rome. While the ring no longer has the gem that once filled its sizeable ovoid bezel, it is inscribed on either side with the Etruscan word SUTHINA, indicating that this object was dedicated as a tomb offering. The words were not etched into the ring but rather were formed by a series of small, discrete punched dots. This item of jewelry, along with a number of the other objects in the tomb, probably belonged to the deceased in life and was then marked accordingly upon his or her death."@en ;

    ecrm:P70_documents "Predictions made using a machine learning algorithm called Gradient Tree Boosting. The software predicts values for four properties, namely 'production timespan', 'production place', 'technique' and 'material'. The predictions are based on the values that are already present for these properties together with the museum name. It is therefore used to fill 'gaps', i.e. missing values for some properties, in the records of the Knowledge Graph and trained with data already present in it. This version of the models is trained on a snapshot of the Knowledge Graph from May 2021. The single task multi-class classification (mutually exclusive classes) models make use of a softmax function, the maximum value output of which corresponds to the provided prediction score." .
